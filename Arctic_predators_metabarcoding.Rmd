### Sample collection
We receieved (*xx*) stomach and fecal samples from ringed seals (*n=XX*), bearded seals (*n=XX*), and beluga whales (*n=XX*) from the Alaskan Department of Fish and Game (ADFG). (*LOCATIONS*), (*SAMPLES WERE FROM STRANGINGS AND INDIGENOUS HARVEST??*) <-- INCLUDE MORE INFORMATION HERE.

### DNA Extraction and Sequencing
- 
- How much sample volume did we use?
- QIAmp Mini Stool Kit <-- did we modify?
"*Whole genomic DNA was extracted from swabbed, wet scooped, and lyophilized samples using the QIAmp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen). . We quantified the amount of DNA extracted from each sample, then amplified the 16S mitochondrial region using published primers and protocols (Van Cise et al. 2024). We determined PCR success through visual examination using gel electrophoresis, and re-amplified unsuccessful samples under a variety of parameters to increase sample success rate. Those parameters included: 1:10 dilution, 1:2 dilution, DNA cleaned using a Zymo Clean and Concetrate kit, and 2x concetration of cleaned DNA. After all iterations of PCR1 were run, we collected those samples with successfully amplified product to continue through the library preparation protocol." *

*Next we cleaned the amplified PCR product using the AMPure bead clean protocol and indexed each sample using Unique Dual Indexes (UDI, Illumina, Inc). ... We then performed a second AMPure bead clean to remove all unused reagents, and pooled all samples to contain an equimolar mix of prey DNA from each sample.*

*Once the amplified product was pooled, we performed a final gel cleaning step using the MinElute PCR purificaton kit (Qiagen, Inc) to remove any non-target DNA fragments, then diluted and denatured the DNA according to the MiSeq sequencing protocol and loaded the pooled DNA and 20% PhiX control onto an in-house MiSeq sequencer.*"

Following automated detection, we conducted a visual validation of the detection data in 1-minute bins to filter out false positive detections. We first removed 4-15 kHz detections and unclassified detections, which do not have the acoustic characteristics of delphinid echolocation clicks. Next, examining only detections in the 15-32 kHz range and 32-45 kHz range, we distinguished and annotated delphinid clicks from ambient noise by scanning detections to identify multiple signals in rapid succession with similar waveforms, spectra, and wigner plots, most often increasing and then decreasing in amplitude as individuals approached and then left the recorder (Supplemental Figure S2). All annotated clicks occurring within the same 1-minute recording were grouped together and given a click event ID.

Due to the prevalence of environmental noise in the dataset - owing largely to snapping shrimp - and the lack of an existing classifier for marine mammals in Puerto Rico or the Gulf of Mexico, click events were not formally classified to species; therefore, we refer to all detections as delphinids throughout this manuscript. We also note here that environmental noise masked all but a small number of tonal signals (i.e. whistles or pulses), such that this data type was excluded from downstream analysis.

We filtered annotated click events to include only those events with > 20 clicks over 150 dB. To determine this threshold, we estimated the expected amplitude of received echolocation signals from delphinids near the farm (<15 m) using the sonar equation assuming geometric spreading and signal attenuation:

$$
RL = SL - 20*log(r) + \alpha*r
$$

where RL is the signal's receive level, SL is the signal's source level, r is the distance in meters from the signal source, and alpha is the absorption rate. Using an absorption rate of 0.03 dB/m [@Fisher1977] and source level of 200 dB [@houser_etal05, @wahlberg_etal11a], we estimated that a received level of 150 dB indicates individuals approached to within ~15 m of the recorder. This allowed us to identify likely interactions with the farm, and also limited the number of false positive interactions, as most ambient noise and false detections were concentrated below 150 dB.



### Data analysis

All data analyses and plots were generated using the R coding language in R studio [@RCoreTeam2016]. To qualitatively examine shifts in the number or duration of farm interactions over the study period, we first grouped filtered click-positive minutes that occurred sequentially into farm interactions and estimated the normalized proportion of interactions (# interactions/# minutes monitoring effort). We also estimated duration of each interaction, by calculating the time difference between the beginning of the first click event and the end of the last click event in the interaction. Following this we used generalized linear models (GLMs) to test for trends in the normalized number or duration of interactions throughout the study period.

We then estimated the binomial probability of interaction at each farm site using a generalized additive modeling (GAM) framework, implemented using mgcv in R @Pedersen2019a. We considered farm location(discrete), farm type (discrete), year (discrete), Julian Day (continuous), and diel proximity to sunrise or sunset (continuous) as potential drivers of interaction probability. Because farm type and farm location are highly correlated, we use only farm location in downstream models. Using the MuMIn package in R, we compared all possible combinations of four potential drivers: diel proximity to sunrise or sunset within each farm location and year, and Julian Day within each farm location and year. This model setup does not assume that the relationship between continuous input variables and the binomial probability is the same across all levels of discrete variables; instead, it allows fitted smoothing splines to vary within strata. We allowed model selection to occur by minimizing AIC, using REML as a secondary decision criteria. After selecting the best model, we identified significant model covariates with a p-value < 0.05 and estimated the predicted interaction probability using these covariates.

In addition to acoustic data collection, visual inspections of the farm sites were conducted on an approximately weekly basis throughout the study periods. Inspections usually lasted between one and three hours, during which time divers would inspect subsurface lines for any damage indicating an interaction or entanglement by marine fauna. We recorded all observations of marine mammals at the farm while observers were present, including the amount of time individuals spent at the farm and their behavior.

## RESULTS {-#RESULTS}

Acoustic data were collected in tandem with farm deployment between January 2021 through January 2024 at two separate farm sites: data collection occurred at Romero in 2021 and 2022, and at Media Luna in 2022 and 2023 (Figure 1). Visual observations were collected during the same time period on an approximately weekly basis, in tandem with diver inspection of the farm structure and biomass. 

During the study period, bottlenose dolphins were the only species visually observed at the farm. They were observed on X occasions, with a visit duration of X. On all occasions, the animals exhibited travel behavior and did not stop at or near the farm for a significant period of time while traveling.

No evidence of entanglement was visually or acoustically observed during the study period; the remainder of the results provide detailed analysis of delphinid behavior and interactions with the farm structure during the study period. 

To allow for manual validation of click detections and standardize monitoring effort across months, up to 10 days of acoustic data were processed from each month in which data were collected. Table S1 summarizes the duration of each deployment, as well as the date range that was automatically processed and manually validated for clicks, the total number of minutes processed each month, and the total number of minutes with positive click detections. Figure 2 shows the total number of minutes processed by month and year throghout the study period.

Automated click detection via PAMGUARD resulted in a high rate of false positives concentrated between 135 and 150 dB, most of which could be attributed to snapping shrimp. Due to this high level of ambient noise at the farm, both physical and biological, most automatically detected clicks were removed from the final dataset during the manual validation step. Figure S2 illustrates the manual validation of click trains embedded in false positive detections.

A total of `r format(sum(NminPos_near_farm$nMinTotal), big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)` minutes were processed through the click detection pipeline. After manual validation of automated detections and filtering to remove click trains with fewer than 10 clicks louder than 150 dB (indicating that animals were likely not within 25m of the recorder), our dataset included `r sum(NminPos_near_farm$nMinPos)`, click-positive minutes, representing approximately `r round((sum(NminPos_near_farm$nMinPos)/sum(NminPos_near_farm$nMinTotal)) * 100,digits = 2)`% of the total dataset. Grouping sequential click-positive minutes resulted in `r nrow(Event_dur_near)` total farm interactions during the study period. The normalized number of interactions per month and year at each farm location did not change significantly over the study period (Figure 2), with notable outliers at the Romero farm site in February, May, and August of 2021.

Over the study period, date accounted for 1% of variability in the duration of interactions, ranging from `r format(round(min(Event_dur_near$eventDur), digits=2), scientific = FALSE)` - `r round(max(Event_dur_near$eventDur), digits = 2)` minutes, with a mean duration of `r round(mean(Event_dur_near$eventDur), digits = 2)` minutes (median = `r round(median(Event_dur_near$eventDur), digits = 2)` minutes). Most interactions were less than 1 minute in duration (n = `r Event_dur_near %>% filter(eventDur < 5) %>% nrow()` of the total `r sum(Event_num_near$nEvent)` interactions). 

GAM model selection indicated that the best fit model (AIC = `r round(dielDetect_dredge$AIC[1], digits = 2)`) included all four covariates and their interaction terms. Significant terms (p < 0.05) included farm location, proximity to sunrise/sunset, and Julian Date, explaining 15.5% of total variance in detection probability. The normalized number of farm interactions per month was significantly greater and with greater variability at the Romero site than at the Media Luna site (Figure 3). Probability of detections at Romero was significantly affected by proximity to sunrise or sunset; the relationship was only significant at Media Luna in one of the two years in which data were recorded. Similarly, Julian Date significantly affected probability of detection at both sites, although with different local trends at each site (Figure 3).

## DISCUSSION {-#DISCUSSION}
  No entanglements were recorded at two seaweed farms deployed off the southwest coast of Puerto Rico between January 2021 and 2024, despite regular-but-infrequent delphinid detections near the farm. Most of these interactions were less than one minute long, indicating that delphinids were passing through the area and were not attracted to the farm structure. Over the same time period, bottlenose dolphins were observed multiple times in the vicinity of the farm - in all cases, the animals passed through or near the farm without stopping. These results indicate that delphinids are able to safely interact with nearshore seaweed farms, and are not attracted to the farm structures. Because bottlenose dolphins are carnivorous, we can anticipate that they are unlikely to be attracted to a macroalgae farm. They are also highly agile in the water and capable of remote sensing via echolocation, which may minimize their risk of entanglement as they pass through an area with a macroalgae farm. 
  While it was not possible to acoustically monitor manatee presence due to masking noise from snapping shrimp other biological life, no manatees were visually observed at the farm during the study period. High resolution tracking manatee movements in the region suggest that they visit Romero and Media Luna reefs only extremely occasionally (REF from Sloane, USGS), and are unlikely to visit the deeper waters near the reefs where the famrs were deployed. However, manatees are herbivorous, which may increase their likelihood of attraction to a farm with significant biomass. They do not generally feed on the carageenan-rich macroalgaes cultivated in these farms, rather they feed primarily on various species of seagrass (e.g. turtle grass (*Thalassia testudinum*), manatee grass (*Syringodium filiforme*), and shoal grass (*Halodule wrightii*)); green algae (*Ulva lactuca*) and some mangrove species comprise secondary components of their diet (@mignucci-giannoni_beck98). Because tropical red macroalgae are not a common component of their diet, it is unlikely that Antillean manatess will habituate to visiting macroalgae farms to forage; however, it is possible that individuals may be attracted by curiosity to a farm with significant algal biomass. Manatees are slow-moving and less agile than delphinids, which may increase their entanglement risk in the farm structure if interaction occurs. 
  
  Significantly more delphinid detections occurred at the Romero farm site than at the Media Luna site, most notably during the first month of the study, coinciding with initial farm deployment, when the rate of interaction was approximately 10%. In the following months, the interaction rate fell to below 5% and did not increase again during the study period. This observed pattern may have been caused by an initial pique of interest by delphinids passing through the area, as bottlenose dolphins are known to be curious. Their curiosity may increase entanglement risk at the onset of farm development if they approach the new structure to investigate and are unable to navigate subsurface lines. Alternatively, the Romero farm may have been located at a site that was previously heavily utilized by delphinids, e.g. as a resting ground or foraging site, which were excluded from the site by the development of the farm. This would be considered would a negative behavioral adaptation, especially the farms are located in areas that are biologically important to the species. Future studies of marine mammal interactions with macroalgal farms should include the collection of baseline data at proposed farm sites for up to 12 months before deployment of the farm structure in order to facilitate the interpretation of patterns observed after the farm is deployed. 
  
  Delphinids exhibited site-specific diel and seasonal trends in probability of detection near the farm: detection probability increased significantly with proximity to sunrise or sunset at both sites, but the trend was more pronounced at the Romero site - possibly driven by the greater overall number of detections at that site. Similarly, we observed significant site-specific seasonal trends in delphinid detections near the farm, with an increase in detections during winter months at Media Luna and in the spring at Romero - although it should be noted that data gaps late in the year and the significant spike in detection early in the year are likely driving the observed pattern at Romero. Similar studies have previously documented site-specific diel and seasonal variability in habitat use in bottlenose dolphins specifically [@cascao_etal20; @fernandez-betelu_etal19], and delpinids broadly [@gannier99; @kanes_etal24; @nuuttila_etal18; @sasaki-yamamoto_etal13; @shaff_baird21; @wang_etal15], which often reflects prey tracking [@monterroso_etal13]. In this case, diel shifts detection near the farm may be a result of dolphins passing through the area to track their prey, which may move offshore into deeper wasters during the day and inshore to shallower waters at night.  
  
  It is important to note that all acoustic monitoring occured while the farm carried a low biomass load. It is aniticpated that higher algae biomass could attract more fish biomass, in turn attracting more marine mammals to the farm site. Anecdotally, researchers monitoring the farm structure observed bottlenose dolphins near the farm for approximately 1 hour on 15 Feb 2024, after acoustic monitoring was completed. Similarly, baracuda were observed at the farm consistenly in January and February of 2024. These observations may be related to growing algal biomass, and may be indicative of the probability of greater attraction of mobile predators to the farm in the future. Higher algae biomass would also visually obscure the farm structure, although it may still be possible for odontocetes to detect the farm structure via echolocation. Finally, higher algae biomass may increase weight on the lines, requiring additional support from floats to remain at the desired depth in the water column. Increased attraction, decreased visibility, or an increase in the amount of gear or line comprised by the farm structure all have the potential to increase entanglement risk and should be taken into consideration as algae farms continue to develop and mature. Continued research and monitoring of marine mammal interactions, either via visual or acoustic data collection, will aide in the quantification of entanglement risk under a variety of scenarios. 
  Despite the successful deployment of nearshore farms with no observed adverse effects on local marine mammal populations, future development at new sites should take care not to extrapolate these results beyond the ecosystem in which the data were collected. All species of marine mammals will react differently to the development of farm structures; therefore the development of any macroalgal farm structure should be accompanied by careful site planning and monitoring. Notably, long-term planning for macroalgal farming includes moving the farm structures into deeper offshore waters in the Gulf of Mexico (REF). This would decrease exposure and entanglement risk for endangered manatees and increase exposure and entanglement risk for offshore odontocetes and baleen whales. Sound-reflective lines may be used to increase the detectability of farms by odontocetes (REF), but few methods currently exist to reduce the risk of baleen whale entanglement in subsurface lines.
  Several critically endangered baleen whales occupy offshore waters in the Carribbean and U.S. North Atlantic Ocean EEZ, including Rice's whale and the North Atlantic right whale [@wursig17; @hayes_etal20; @rosel_etal21]. Entanglement is a threat to both of these species [@iucn24; @kraus_etal16]. While this study indicates that echolocating odontocete cetaceans are likely to be able to interact safely with the farm, it is unknown whether farm interactions by baleen whales would result in entanglement. Detection of baleen whales in the waters surrounding Puerto Rico is rare; nontheless, any development of offshore macroalgae farms should be accompanied by robust visual and acoustic surveys of baleen whale abundance before farm development. A successful macroalgae farm would be placed in a site that minimizes the likelihood of interactions from either of these species, and would be accompanied by regular monitoring to ensure early detection of any entanglements that do occur. Ideally, a real-time, automated acoustic detection system such as has been implemented for North Atlantic right whales in Cape Cod Bay [@baumgartner_etal19] would be implemented alongside any farms deployed in offshore sites where there is higher risk of entanglement.
    
## CONCLUSION {-}
Here we provide the first quantitative analysis of the rate of delphinid interactions with macroalgae aquaculture structures. Our results indicate that delphinids are able to safely interact with farm structures without entanglement; however, it is possible that these structures excluded delphinids from biologically important areas. We recommend that any future development of macroalgae farms include acoustic monitoring of marine mammal interactions. In addition to monitoring delphinid activity at the farm, the studies should plan to collect data at the proposed farm site for a period of up to a year prior to the deployment of the farm in order to quantify and characterize delphinid presence and activity in the area. We further highlight diel and seasonal patterns in delphinid activity that suggest entanglement risk may vary over time. The results of this study may provide insight into the placement of new macroalgae farms in similar coastal ecosystems; however, we caution that the results of this study are not applicable in ecosystems with different marine mammal species, and that endangered baleen whales living in offshore environments may be especially vulnerable to complex underwater structures such as macroalgae farms.
